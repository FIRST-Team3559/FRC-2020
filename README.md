# FRC-2020

### 17MAR2021

Java code for FIRST team 3559. This code was developed primarily by Edwin Sanchez for use on the robot in the 2020 game; Infinite Recharge.
It was developed in VSCode with the WPI plugin. Due to the chaos of the truncated season, the development of this code was cut short. You may find incomplete sections that were not finished. 

A more complete version of this code may be found in the ** FRC-2021 ** repository. _After all, it was the same robot, only better._
